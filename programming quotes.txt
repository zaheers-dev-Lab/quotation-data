Here are a few programming quotes with a similar vibe to **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**:

1. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**
   *“Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.”* – Extreme Programming Principle

2. **SOLID**
   A set of design principles that aim to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

   * **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
   * **O**pen/Closed Principle
   * **L**iskov Substitution Principle
   * **I**nterface Segregation Principle
   * **D**ependency Inversion Principle

3. **WET (Write Everything Twice)**
   The opposite of DRY, a term used to warn against overly repetitive code that can lead to redundancy.

4. **RTFM (Read The Fine Manual)**
   A cheeky reminder to always check the documentation before asking questions.

5. **Fail Fast**
   “Detect and respond to errors as soon as possible, rather than allowing them to propagate and cause bigger issues later.”

6. **Good Enough Is the Enemy of Perfect**
   The idea that striving for perfection can often delay or prevent progress. It's better to ship something functional and iterate on it.

7. **Premature Optimization Is the Root of All Evil**
   “Don’t optimize code until you’ve identified actual performance bottlenecks.”

8. **There Are Only Two Hard Things in Computer Science: Cache Invalidation and Naming Things**
   This is a funny but true statement about two of the most difficult aspects of programming.

9. **Code Like You’re Going to Have to Maintain It for the Next 5 Years**
   A reminder that maintainable, clean code pays off in the long run.

10. **"If it works, don’t touch it."**
    A reminder to avoid unnecessary changes to code that is already functioning as intended.

✨ THE ULTIMATE GUIDE to Escaping the WET Trap! ✨

1. Identify the Duplicates: 🕵️‍♂️ Scan your code for repeated logic. Are you writing the same if statement or API call over and over?

2. Abstract the Logic: 🪄 Pull that common code out and place it inside a single, reusable function. Give it a clear, descriptive name! 📝

3. Refactor & Replace: 🔄 Go back and replace all those old, duplicated code blocks with a single, elegant call to your new function.

4. Enjoy the Freedom: 🎉 Watch your codebase shrink! 🤏 Enjoy cleaner, more readable code and easier maintenance! 🔧 #UltimateGuide #DRYCode
